;; Basic protocol messages. HELLO-REPLY is sent to connecting clients (as
;; a response to a protocol setup request implied by connection
;; establishment). It contains the protocol version offered by the
;; server. If the client does not implement the protocol version
;; specified by the server's HELLO-REPLY it must close the connection.
;;
;; ERROR-REPLY is a generic reply sent to clients when a request can not
;; be successfully served for any reason. It contains a string that
;; further describes the failure reason.
;;
;; ACK-REPLY is a generic reply sent to clients when a request was
;; successfully processed by the server. It contains no additional
;; information. It is generally used to acknowledge requests that do not
;; yield any datum.
