Long description:

NAME

A symbol which satisfies one of the following:
    (find-class '<NAME>) returns a class.
    Symbol <NAME>-p in the same package is fbound. It should be a unary function, or the consequence is undefined.
    Symbol <NAME>p in the same package is fbound. It should be a unary function, or the consequence is undefined.

    Note that since the existence of the actual class <NAME> is not required, it is permissible to assume a
    normal function like STRINGP or PATHNAMEP (including user-defined function like MYPRED-P) in the second
    and the third case.

SLOTS

one of the following:

make-instance style plist:  :keyword subpattern
    Example:  (structure myclass :slot-a (list a b))
with-slots style:           (slot-name subpattern)
    Example:  (structure myclass (slot-a (list a b)))
with-accessors style: (accessor-name subpattern)

    accessor-name is a symbol, where the corresponding accessor function should be fbound to one of the
    following symbols:

        Symbol accessor-name itself. (common style for generic functions)
        Symbol <class-name>-<accessor-name> in the same package. (common style for structure accessor functions)
        Symbol <class-name><accessor-name> in the same package. (compatibility to Optima)

        Example: (structure mystructure (a (list a b))) tries to find an accessor named either A ,
        MYSTRUCTURE-A or MYSTRUCTUREA .

slot-name :

     The value returned by (slot-value <obj> '<slot-name>) is bound to the variable of the same name. Consider
     it as an abbreviation of (slot-name slot-name).

     Example : (structure myclass slot-a)

accessor-name :

     The value returned by the accessor is bound to the variable of the same name.  Consider it as an
     abbreviation of (accessor-name accessor-name).

     Example : (structure mystructure a)
