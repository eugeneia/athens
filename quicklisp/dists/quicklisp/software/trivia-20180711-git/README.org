+ news! new pattern: lambda-list pattern. Contributed by akssri
+ news! new pattern: number-related patterns, e.g. >, <, =, <= ... 
+ news! Inline pattern implemented ! : @, @@ ...
+ news!(04/02/2016) Support for fare-quasiquote is now available. See =test/quasiquote= for the usage
+ news!(04/22/2016) Added metabang-bind like macros =if-match=, =when-match=, =unless-match=, =let-match=, =let*-match=, =let-match1=
+ news!(05/21/2016) Added support for minor implementations: CMU, ECL, CLISP, ABCL.
+ news!(05/22/2016) Implemented =ARRAY=, =SIMPLE-ARRAY=, =ARRAY-ROW-MAJOR=, =ARRAY-ROW-MAJOR*= patterns! Multi-dimentional arrays are now more handy!
+ news!(07/21/2016) Added =READ=, =LAST=, =SPLIT=, =SPLIT*= patterns! Parsing the string is more conveninent.
+ news!(01/21/2017) Added =DYNAMIC= pattern! Careful use of this pattern can impact the performance sensitive code.
+ news!(04/08/2017) Added a new contrib package =TRIVIA.CFFI= which provides =->= pattern ! Offers convenient access to foreign objects.
+ *news!(05/26/2018)* Added =property!=, which only matches when the key is present in a plist.

* Trivia : Trivial Pattern Matching Compiler

Trivia is a pattern matching compiler that is *compatible with Optima*.
It shares the same testing code with Optima and acts as a
drop-in replacement for 99% usage. For the basic usage, consult [[https://github.com/guicho271828/trivia/wiki][our wiki]].
*Known differences between Optima and Trivia, which are bug, are [[https://github.com/guicho271828/trivia/wiki/Known-Differences][described here]] (7/31/2016)*

#+BEGIN_SRC diff

(match '(something #(0 1 2))
  ((list a (vector 0 _ b))
   (values a b)))
;; --> SOMETHING, 2
#+END_SRC

Patterns compiled with Trivia runs *[[https://github.com/guicho271828/trivia/wiki/Benchmarking-Results][faster than Optima]]*.

[1]: trivia is using :balland2006 optimiizer

... and Trivia is *more extensible*. In fact, Trivia's =defpattern= is able
to implement all of [[https://github.com/m2ym/optima#constructor-pattern][unmodifiable, core pattern language]] in Optima within itself.

* Dependency & Testing

+ Level 0,1 : Alexandria only.
+ Level 2 : Additionally, lisp-namespace and closer-mop.

To run the tests with trivial optimizer, =(asdf:test-system :trivia)= .

In order to run the same test with =:balland2006= optimizer activated, run follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
;; $ git clone https://github.com/guicho271828/trivia.balland2006
;; $ git clone https://github.com/guicho271828/type-i

(asdf:test-system :trivia.balland2006.enabled)
#+END_SRC

To run the benchmark:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(asdf:test-system :trivia.benchmark)
#+END_SRC
