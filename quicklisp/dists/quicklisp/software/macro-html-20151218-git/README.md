# macro-html

**Description:**

*macro-html* is a HTML generation library. It aims to be fast, modular,
cachable and concise. It does so by defining each tag as a macro which
expands to code printing the respective HTML source. It also employs a
DSL for expressing element attributes and a basic library of reusable
HTML widgets.
